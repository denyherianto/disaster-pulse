# Disaster Pulse - AI Agents Flow Video Prompt

**Context:**
A sophisticated, "Enterprise-Grade" explainer video for "Disaster Pulse". The style should be **Professional, Modern, and Trustworthy**.

**Scene Description:**
Show the **Full End-to-End Intelligence Pipeline**: from raw chaos (Data Sources) -> through the AI Reasoning Engine -> to clear Impact (Alerts).

**Visual Elements:**
1.  **Background:** Soft, off-white/light-grey mesh gradient (#F9FAFB to #EFF6FF).
2.  **Section 1: Ingestion (Left):**
    *   Raw data icons floating in: "BMKG (Sensor)", "TikTok (Video)", "Reports (User)".
    *   They merge into a single "Signal Stream".
3.  **Section 2: The Reasoning Engine (Center):**
    *   The 5-Agent Pipeline (Observer -> Classifier -> Skeptic -> Synthesizer -> Action).
    *   Professional "Glass-morphic" Lite nodes.
4.  **Section 3: Impact (Right):**
    *   The output isn't just text, it's an **Interface Update**.
